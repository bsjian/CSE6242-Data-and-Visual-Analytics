Average node degree: 1.049
Node degree is the number of edges on a node, independent of the in or out relation. Average node degree is the average of node degrees of all nodes in a graph.

Diameter of the graph: 5
It is the maximum graph distance between two nodes in the generated network.

Average path length: 2.953710927341759
Graph distance can be measured between pair of nodes with 1 being the shortest and diameter being the longest. Average path length is the average graph distance between all pairs of nodes in a graph.
